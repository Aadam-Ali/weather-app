üñ•Ô∏è [Live Preview](https://aadam-ali.github.io/weather-app/)

## Description

Weather app created using the OpenWeatherMap API. Simple UI that works on all devices with a simple search bar that activates on the press of the search icon.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan on migrating this application to React instead of vanilla JavaScript and HTML.

## Known Bugs

The only bug that I am aware of at this time is the formatting of longer named cities on smaller devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- OpenWeatherMap API
